<h1>Bookshare Web Application</h1>

It connects users who need to share or collect printed books or pdf books from other users. The main purpose of this web application is to connect those users who want to borrow a book from others (who have that book). A user can make a request for a specific book. If someone has that book, he gives a response and shares his book. 
The secondary feature is the pdf version of book sharing. A valid user can share pdf books and others can download the available pdf books.

It was an individual project. Languages or technologies it employed: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL.
